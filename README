This software is a prototype implementation of the on-line fault tolerant
matrix multiplication(FTGEMM) described in the paper

Fault Tolerant Matrix-Matrix Multiplication: Correcting Soft Errors On-Line
(under review)

This project is in its very early stage; it's only for testing ideas now.

Before compiling you should modify make.inc properly.

To compile:
    make

To test ft_dgemm:
    ./test/dgemm_test matrix_size error_rate




CHANGELOG:

TODOs:
- time and probably optimize verify_checksum subroutine by blocking
- implement BLAS compatitble interface
- add automated empirical test of block size
- adjust noise threads parameters, define exactly what FR means.
